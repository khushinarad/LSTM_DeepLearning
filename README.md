Deep Learning Assignment 5

Project Title:
Deep Learning Model Implementation

Submitted By:
Khushi Dewanand Narad

Description:

This project involves building and evaluating a deep learning model as part of Assignment 5. The implementation focuses on applying neural network concepts for solving a classification or prediction problem using Deep Learning techniques.

The Google Colab Notebook (DL_Assignment_5_Lab_Khushi.ipynb) covers:

Data preprocessing

Model architecture design

Model compilation and training

Performance evaluation on test data

Analysis of results through metrics such as accuracy and loss

Technologies Used:

Python

Google Colab

Deep Learning Libraries:

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

How to Run:

Open the file DL_Assignment_5_Lab_Khushi.ipynb in Google Colab.

Run all the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate performance.

Ensure the following libraries are available (Google Colab has them pre-installed):


pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib

If an external dataset is required, upload it into the Colab environment as per instructions inside the notebook.

Results:

The model achieves [mention achieved accuracy here]% accuracy (or specify loss value) on the test dataset, demonstrating effective learning and prediction.

Important Notes:

Make sure the runtime type is set to Python 3 and GPU is selected if required for faster training.

All necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook.

Execute all code cells in order without skipping to avoid errors.
